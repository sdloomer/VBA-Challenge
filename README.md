Module 2 Challenge - VBA

Starting out, I initially used dblMin and dblMax to find both the Greatest % Increase and Greatest % Decrease in my second table of results, but I found it would be easier to loop through the first table I created to find both those values and their corresponding tickers. 

During my initial trial for these values I found this website:
https://www.excelanytime.com/excel/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=105:find-smallest-and-largest-value-in-range-with-vba-excel&catid=79&Itemid=475
that helped me find the maximum and minimum values in the column. I ended up not needing these functions though!

I also received some advice from both my classmates Ethan Musa and Sneha Thomas about how to declare and store my opening and closing prices as variables. I think I was trying to run my loop without doing this and it took me a little bit for it to finally click!
